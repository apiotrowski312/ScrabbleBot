# Roadmap

## Stuff to achive with prototype/0.3

- [ ] Add blanks (it will require a lot of work I guess)
- [ ] Add two more functions for word search
- [ ] Fix current function with searching for words. Make it easier to use
- [ ] Add checker to be sure all letter are capital letters.

Trace level - info about e.g function calls
Debug level - info about expected errors
Info - info about placed word, winner etc

1. Make it possible to search for Hooks type 3 (how?)
2. Add more inteligence to "AI". It should know that it's better to gain less points and use hard letters.
3. Extract grabble functions from gaddag package (package should not have dependencies on it)
4. Add blanks (I have to think about better approach than adding more parameters eveyrwhere)
