## Stuff to achive with prototype/0.3

- [ ] Add blanks (it will require a lot of work I guess)
- [ ] Add two more functions for word search
  - [ ] Look for all words, do not care about hooks
  - [ ] Find all words, when hook from strange place (like eg. WORD and adding S would be connecting point)
- [ ] Fix current function with searching for words. Make it easier to use
- [x] Extract incrementing round to external fuction and add logging
- [x] Add multiple level logging (for MA)
- [X] Move fixtures to one place, so it will be easier to handle
