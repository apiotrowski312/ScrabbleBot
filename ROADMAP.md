# Roadmap

## Stuff to achive with prototype/0.3

- [ ] Add blanks (it will require a lot of work I guess)
- [ ] Add two more functions for word search
  - [ ] Find all words, when hook from strange place (like eg. WORD and adding S would be connecting point)
- [ ] Fix current function with searching for words. Make it easier to use
- [ ] Add comments to all exported functions

Trace level - info about e.g function calls
Debug level - info about expected errors
Info - info about placed word, winner etc


1. Make it possible to search for Hooks type 3 (how?)
2. Extract grabble functions from gaddag package (package should not have dependencies on it)
3. Add blanks (I have to think about better approach than adding more parameters eveyrwhere)
