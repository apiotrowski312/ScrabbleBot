# Scrabble Bot

This repo is under heavy development.

All available commands are under `make help` command.

## Tests

Call `make unit` to run all unit tests.

Call `make bench` to run all benchmark tests.

## To do

- Improve tests. Add tests for more edge cases. (To improve code quality and coverage) 
- Add. Bonus 50 points when user put all 8 letters on board at once

## Ideas

- Maybe better option is to use transpose array than use two version of the same algorithm?
